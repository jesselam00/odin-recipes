    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> 
        The Black Cherry Pies are one of the most popular linear frankenswitches.
        The BCPs have become a fairly commonly instituted frankenswitch that is readily featured in a rather large number of sound tests on YouTube. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>JWK bottom housing (H1, Alpaca, Jwick) </li>
        <li>Kailh cream stem (or equivalent like Kailh black stem) </li>
        <li>Any stock or aftermarket spring of your choice (JWK stock springs recommended over the Kailh or Cherry springs)</li>
        <li>Cherry top housing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Harvest JWK bottoms from a linear JWK switch (H1, Alpaca, Jwick).</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure you keep the JWK springs if you don't plan on buying any aftermarket springs!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Harvest Kailh cream stems from a Novelkeys Cream switch. 
            There are many other alternative stems that can be used for the BCPs like the Kailh black switches.</li>
        <li>Harvest the top housing from a Cherry MX switch. It is recommended to harvest them from Cherry MX Black switches.</li>
        <li>Begin assembling the switch, take a JWK bottom housing and lube it with Krytox 205g0.</li>
        <li>Take your spring and lube it. Place it on the pole of the JWK bottom housing.</li>
        <li>Take your Kailh stem and lube it. Place it on the spring where the legs of the stem face towards the leaf of the bottom housing.</li>
        <li>Finish assembling the switch by snapping on the Cherry top housing on your Black Cherry Pie switch. There is no need to lube the top housing.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Congrats! You have created your Black Cherry Pie switches!</p>
