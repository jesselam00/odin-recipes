    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> 
        The Creamsicles are one of the smoothest linear frankenswitches. 
        It utilizes an cream stem which is extremely smooth when paired with the housing of C3 tangerines.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>C3 tangerine top and bottom housing</li>
        <li>Kailh cream stem (or equivalent like Kailh black stem) </li>
        <li>Any stock or aftermarket spring of your choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Harvest tangerine top and bottom housings from a C3 tangerine switch.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure you keep the springs if you don't plan on buying any aftermarket springs!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Harvest Kailh cream stems from a Novelkeys Cream switch. 
            There are many other alternative stems that can be used for the Creamsicles like the Kailh black switches.</li>
        <li>Begin assembling the switch, take a tangerine bottom housing and lube it with Krytox 205g0.</li>
        <li>Take your spring and lube it. Place it on the pole of the tangerine bottom housing.</li>
        <li>Take your Kailh stem and lube it. Place it on the spring where the legs of the stem face towards the leaf of the bottom housing.</li>
        <li>Finish assembling the switch by snapping on the tangerine top housing on your Creamsicle switch. There is no need to lube the top housing.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Congrats! You have created your Creamsicle switches!</p>
